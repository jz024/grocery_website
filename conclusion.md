## Results

The evaluation of our meal-planning assistant, based on user feedback from the SmartCart
survey, highlights its effectiveness in simplifying meal selection and enhancing the grocery
shopping experience. A majority of users (82%) found that the system made meal plan-
ning easier, with many appreciating the structured approach to generating personalized
meal recommendations. However, some users noted that certain meal suggestions did not
fully align with their preferences or contained hard-to-find ingredients. In terms of grocery
shopping efficiency, 75% of users reported a positive impact, particularly due to the auto-
matically generated shopping lists and store recommendations. Nonetheless, some users
encountered occasional mismatches between the recommended stores and actual product
availability due to a lack of real-time inventory tracking. Route optimization was also well-
received, with 79% of users finding it helpful for planning their shopping trips, though those
in rural areas reported difficulties due to limited grocery store data. Personalization was a
strong aspect of the system, as 88% of users found the meal recommendations relevant to
their tastes, and 90% confirmed that their dietary restrictions were accurately considered.
However, some users expressed a desire for more transparency in how recommendations
were generated, along with additional flexibility in ingredient substitutions. These findings
suggest that while the assistant effectively streamlines meal planning and grocery shopping
for most users, improvements in real-time pricing and inventory tracking, expanded gro-
cery store coverage, and enhanced customization options could further optimize the user
experience.


## Conclusion

This project presents an innovative meal-planning LLM agent that significantly enhances the
user experience by streamlining meal selection, shopping list generation, and grocery store
recommendations. Through the integration of a React Native frontend, FastAPI backend
services, Firebase Firestore, and Google Maps API, the system provides a seamless, efficient,
and personalized meal-planning assistant for busy home cooks.
The evaluation results demonstrate that the system successfully simplifies meal planning
and grocery shopping, with a majority of users reporting improved efficiency in selecting
meals, generating shopping lists, and planning store visits. The ability to provide person-
alized meal recommendations and optimize grocery store selection was particularly well-
received. However, some limitations were identified, including occasional mismatches in
product availability, challenges in rural areas due to limited store data, and a lack of real-
time pricing information. Additionally, while the majority of users found meal suggestions
relevant, some desired greater flexibility in ingredient substitutions and increased trans-
parency in recommendation logic.
To further enhance the system, future work should focus on integrating real-time pricing
APIs from grocery retailers to provide more accurate cost estimates and product availability
updates. Expanding the ingredient substitution feature would allow users to customize their
shopping lists more effectively based on personal preferences or dietary restrictions. Fur-
thermore, improving store data coverage, particularly in rural and less densely populated
areas, would ensure that users across different regions receive high-quality recommenda-
tions. Additional refinements, such as the ability to prioritize organic or locally sourced in-
gredients and incorporating real-time stock tracking, could further improve the assistant’s
functionality and user satisfaction.
Overall, the results validate the system’s potential as a practical and intelligent solution for
meal planning and grocery shopping. By addressing the identified limitations and incorpo-
rating user-driven improvements, future iterations of the assistant could provide an even
more seamless and adaptable experience, catering to a broader range of users and shopping
needs.

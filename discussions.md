## Discussion

The evaluation results demonstrate that our meal-planning assistant effectively streamlines
meal selection and grocery shopping for most users. The integration of Firebase Firestore,
FastAPI, and Google Maps API enabled a seamless experience, with meal recommendations
and shopping lists tailored to user preferences. Compared to existing meal-planning appli-
cations such as Mealime and Paprika, our system offers a higher degree of personalization
and convenience by incorporating real-time store location data. While AI-driven recommen-
dation systems, such as IBM Watson Meal Planner, provide personalized meal suggestions,
they lack the direct integration with grocery stores and automated shopping list generation
that our system provides.
Despite these advantages, some challenges remain. Users in less densely populated areas
experienced difficulty finding relevant grocery store recommendations due to limited store
data, a limitation also observed in prior studies on location-based retail applications. While
the system aimed to optimize cost efficiency, the absence of real-time store pricing some-
times led to inaccurate cost estimates, a common issue in online grocery shopping platforms
that rely on static pricing models. Additionally, some users expressed interest in more flex-
ible meal customization options, such as ingredient substitutions and dietary-specific meal
plans, indicating a need for greater adaptability in future iterations.
To further improve the system, several enhancements can be considered. Implementing
real-time pricing APIs from grocery retailers could improve cost estimation accuracy, ad-
dressing a key limitation of the current approach. Expanding the ingredient substitution
feature would provide users with greater flexibility in adjusting their meal plans based on
availability and dietary preferences. Additionally, increasing store data coverage in rural
areas through partnerships with regional grocery chains could enhance the system’s usabil-
ity in underserved locations. Another promising direction is improving the transparency
of recommendation logic, allowing users to understand why certain meal suggestions are
made, which could improve trust and user engagement.
Overall, the SmartCart system demonstrates strong potential as a practical solution for meal
planning and grocery shopping. While it effectively personalizes meal recommendations
and optimizes grocery store selection, addressing the identified limitations in future iter-
ations will enhance its reliability and user satisfaction. Future work should also explore
machine learning-driven optimization techniques for balancing price, distance, and ingre-
dient availability in real time, further refining the system’s ability to meet user needs.
